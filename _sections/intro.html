In solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, and in support of the ongoing struggle against police brutality, we will be donating the proceeds from our next event to the Massachusetts Bail Fund. And from now until the event, we will be donating all proceeds from our Bandcamp pages to Mass Bail Fund, as well.
