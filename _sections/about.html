<div itemprop="description"><!-- itemscope cake factory -->
Cake factory is a Boston-based collective and label that hosts techno shows every last Saturday of the month, and releases music semi-regularly.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Shows will be streamed here, until it is safe to gather again. Can't wait to see everyone again.

<div>
Cake Factory is focused on the cultivation of local, underground techno and ambient music in Boston, MA. We are actively seeking submissions from Boston-based techno and ambient artists for future events. POC, LGBTQ+, non-binary, and/or female-identifying artists are particularly encouraged to submit their work.

<br>
<div>
If you would like to be considered for upcoming events (or if you know someone that you think should be considered), please submit a link to your/their website that includes a representative recording. If we think your/their music would be a good fit, we will respond as soon as we can about potential dates. We're a small operation though and appreciate your patience.
